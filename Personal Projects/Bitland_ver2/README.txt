GUIDE

This game has simple mechanics.
Food is represented as a '&' in the map.

Finding food will increase your food supply.
Pressing 'E' will allow you to eat!

W - A - S - D is for movement.

A village always has food available, and you
can find villages every 5 levels.

As you battle, your atk points will go up.
So feel free to grind in mazes!

In every maze, you will randomly encounter
a variety of enemies. So be careful!

Finding '*' in a maze will allow you to move
up a level, which will increase your max hp
as well.

Try to make it to level 61 and defeat the
boss!

If your hp drops to 0 in a battle, you
will die... and will have to restart.

PLay wisely, brave player!
Good luck!
